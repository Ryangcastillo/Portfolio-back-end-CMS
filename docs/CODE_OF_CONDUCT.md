#### **Code Review Standards**
```markdown
# Good Code Review Comment Examples

## Constructive Feedback
‚úÖ "Consider using a Map here instead of nested loops for better O(n) performance."
‚úÖ "This function is getting large. Could we extract the validation logic into a separate helper?"
‚úÖ "Great work on the error handling! One suggestion: could we add a user-friendly error message?"

## What to Avoid
‚ùå "This code is terrible."
‚ùå "Why didn't you just do it the obvious way?"
‚ùå "Everyone knows you should never do this."
```

#### **Issue Reporting Guidelines**
```markdown
# Good Issue Example

## Title: [Bug] Content editor loses unsaved changes on page refresh

### Description
When editing content in the content editor and accidentally refreshing the page, all unsaved changes are lost without warning.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to /content/create
2. Add content to the editor
3. Refresh the page
4. Observe that content is lost

### Expected Behavior
User should be warned about unsaved changes before page refresh.

### Environment
- Browser: Chrome 118.0
- OS: macOS Ventura 13.6
- Version: main branch (commit abc123)

### Additional Context
This affects user experience significantly as users may lose significant work.
```

### ü§ñ AI Collaboration Standards

#### **Working with AI Assistants**
Following our Agent Guidelines (see `/docs/AGENT_GUIDELINES.md`):

- **Clear Instructions**: Provide clear, specific instructions to AI assistants
- **Verify Output**: Always review and test AI-generated code before merging
- **Human Oversight**: Maintain human decision-making authority for architectural choices
- **Transparency**: Document when AI tools were used in significant contributions
- **Quality Standards**: Hold AI-generated content to the same quality standards as human contributions

#### **AI Tool Usage**
```markdown
# Acceptable AI Usage Examples
‚úÖ "Generated initial test cases using GitHub Copilot, then reviewed and customized"
‚úÖ "Used AI to help write documentation, verified accuracy against codebase"
‚úÖ "AI-assisted refactoring with human review of all changes"

# Unacceptable AI Usage
‚ùå Blindly committing AI-generated code without review
‚ùå Using AI to generate content that violates project standards
‚ùå Claiming AI work as original human contribution
```

- **Respond Promptly**: Address review comments in a timely manner
- **Keep PRs Focused**: One logical change per pull request

#### **Commit Message Standards** 
Following conventional commits:
```bash

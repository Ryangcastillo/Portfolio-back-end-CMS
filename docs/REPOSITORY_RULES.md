# Repository Rules & Contribution Guidelines

> Comprehensive guidelines for contributing to Stitch CMS, following constitutional principles

**Reference**: CONST-P10 (Change Traceability), CONST-P6 (Spec-Driven Change Flow)

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

These rules define how to manage the Git repository that houses your project. They help ensure a clean history, consistent collaboration and integration with AIâ€‘driven workflows like Spec Kit. All contributions must follow these guidelines and align with our [Constitutional Principles](docs/governance/CONSTITUTION.md).

## Version control

1. **Initialize Git immediately** â€“ Commit the initial project scaffolding (including specs, plans and docs) on day one. Enable branch protection on the main branch.
2. **Feature branches** â€“ Create a new branch for every feature, bug fix or documentation change using a clear naming convention such as `feature/<shortâ€‘description>`, `bugfix/<issueâ€‘id>` or `docs/<topic>`.
3. **Semantic commit messages** â€“ Write concise messages following Conventional Commits:
    - **Prefix** / **Purpose**
    - `feat` â€“ Adds a new feature
    - `fix` â€“ Bug fix
    - `docs` â€“ Documentation only
    - `style` â€“ Formatting, missing semi colons, etc.
    - `refactor` â€“ Code changes that do not alter functionality
4. **Keep commits small** â€“ Commit at logical breakpoints (after completing a task or small subâ€‘feature) to simplify reviews and enable easy reverts.
5. **Tag releases** â€“ Use Semantic Versioning to tag significant milestones (e.g., `v1.2.0`). Include release notes summarizing changes and linking to the relevant spec and plan documents.

## Pull requests

- **Always open a PR** â€“ Never merge directly into `main`. Open a pull request from your feature branch.
- **Describe the change** â€“ Provide a highâ€‘level summary, list linked issues or tasks, and reference the relevant spec/plan sections. Include screenshots or logs when helpful.
- **Link to tasks** â€“ If you use Spec Kit, link the pull request to the `/tasks` item(s) that this PR implements. This creates traceability from specification â†’ plan â†’ tasks â†’ code.
- **Request review early** â€“ Seek feedback as soon as you have a working slice. Encourage reviewers to compare against the specification and technical plan.
- **Require checks** â€“ Configure branch protection so that all tests, linters and security scanners must pass before merging. Use GitHub Actions to run unit tests, lint checks and style checks automatically.
- **Small, focused PRs** â€“ Avoid large PRs. Each pull request should implement a small set of tasks to ease review and reduce merge conflicts.

---

## Branch workflow

- **Main branch** â€“ Always represents the latest stable release. Protected; only reviewed, passing pull requests may be merged.
- **Develop branch** (optional) â€“ Use if your team prefers GitFlow. Feature branches merge into `develop`; release branches are cut from `develop` and merged back into `develop` and `main`.
- **Hotfix branch** â€“ For urgent fixes to production; branch from `main`, fix, test and merge back into both `main` and `develop`.
- **Release branch** â€“ When preparing a new version, create `release/<version>` from `develop`. Perform final testing and documentation updates here before merging back.

## Repositoryâ€‘level instructions for Copilot and other agents

- **Define instructions in `.github/copilot.md`** â€“ Provide repositoryâ€‘wide guidance on naming conventions, architecture patterns and prohibited practices. Copilot will use these instructions to generate more relevant suggestions.
- **Keep instructions up to date** â€“ Whenever project rules evolve (e.g., new ESLint rules or changes in architecture), update the Copilot instructions and commit them so that agents always have current context.
- **Exclude sensitive content** â€“ Use `.github/copilot-ignore.txt` or similar mechanisms to exclude secrets or proprietary code from Copilot's context.

## Integrating Spec Kit

Spec Kit promotes specâ€‘driven development and ties documentation to implementation:

1. **Initialize** â€“ Run `uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init <project-name>` to bootstrap a new project.
2. **Constitution** â€“ Run `/constitution` to create governing principles for code quality, testing, UX and performance. Commit this file (typically under `specs/constitution.md`) to version control.
3. **Specification** â€“ Use `/specify` to describe what you are building stored under `specs/` and treat it as the source of truth.
4. **Plan** â€“ Use `/plan` to produce a technical plan with architecture and constraints under `specs/plan.md` and keep it updated as requirements evolve.
5. **Tasks** â€“ Use `/tasks` to generate a list of actionable tasks. Commit the resulting document. Store it. Create issues or Kanban cards for each task and link them to the spec and plan.
6. **Implementation** â€“ Implement tasks sequentially or in parallel. Commit code with references to the corresponding tasks and update the spec/plan if assumptions change.
7. **By versioning the constitution, spec, plan and tasks alongside your code, you preserve knowledge and ensure AI agents always work from the latest requirements.**

## Security and compliance

- **Secret scanning** â€“ Enable GitHub's secret scanning and push protection to prevent committing credentials.
- **Dependency management** â€“ Use Dependabot or Renovate to monitor dependency updates and vulnerabilities. Keep your `package.json` and lockfiles current.
- **Code scanning** â€“ Enable GitHub Advanced Security (or an equivalent scanner) to detect vulnerable patterns. Configure it to run on every pull request.

Following these repository rules ensures a clean, auditable history and smooth collaboration between humans and AI agents.

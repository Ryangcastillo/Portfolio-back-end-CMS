- Error handling and edge cases

### 4. E2E Test Orchestrator (`run-e2e-tests.sh`)
Coordinates all tests and provides comprehensive reporting:
- Service health checking
- Automated service startup (optional)
- Sequential test execution
- Result aggregation and reporting
- Cleanup and teardown

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Backend service
export BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:8000"

# Frontend service  
export FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Test user credentials
export TEST_USERNAME="test_user"
export TEST_PASSWORD="test_password_123"
```

### Service Requirements
- **Backend**: FastAPI server running on port 8000
- **Frontend**: Next.js application running on port 3000
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with test schema
- **Python**: Virtual environment with dependencies installed
- **Node.js**: npm packages installed

## 📊 Test Results and Reporting

### Console Output
Tests provide real-time feedback with color-coded results:
- 🔵 `[INFO]` - Test progress information
- ✅ `[PASS]` - Successful test completion
- ❌ `[FAIL]` - Test failure with details
- ⚠️ `[WARN]` - Non-critical issues

### Generated Reports
Comprehensive markdown reports are generated in `reports/`:
- Test execution summary
- Individual test results
- Performance metrics
- System health status
- Recommendations for improvements

### Example Report Structure

## 🐛 Debugging Failed Tests

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Backend Connection Errors
```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl http://localhost:8000/docs

# Start backend manually
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

#### Frontend Loading Issues
```bash
# Check if frontend is running
curl http://localhost:3000

# Start frontend manually
npm run dev
```

#### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check database connection
psql -h localhost -U your_user -d cms_test

# Run database migrations
cd backend
alembic upgrade head
```

#### Authentication Failures
- Verify test user credentials in test scripts
- Check JWT token configuration
- Ensure database has user table schema

### Debug Mode
Run tests with verbose logging:
```bash
# Enable debug mode
DEBUG=1 ./scripts/run-e2e-tests.sh

# Run individual tests with debug
DEBUG=1 python3 ./scripts/test-content-flow.py
```

## 🔄 Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Integration
The testing suite integrates with the existing CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
- name: Run E2E Tests
  run: |
    ./scripts/run-e2e-tests.sh --start-services
  env:
    BACKEND_URL: http://localhost:8000
    FRONTEND_URL: http://localhost:3000
```

### Automated Scheduling
Set up automated health checks:
```bash
# Add to crontab for daily health checks
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/cms && ./scripts/run-e2e-tests.sh > /var/log/cms-health.log 2>&1
```

# ADR-0001: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy for Backend Architecture

## Status
**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-09-20  
**Deciders**: Project Team  
**Consulted**: Development Team  
**Informed**: All Contributors  

## Context and Problem Statement
We need to establish the core backend technology stack for Stitch CMS. The backend must handle REST API endpoints, database operations, authentication, and integration with external services while supporting the principles defined in our Constitution.

**Key Requirements**:
- API-first development approach (CONST-P1)
- Async and non-blocking operations (CONST-P2)
- Extensibility through clear abstractions (CONST-P3)
- Security by default (CONST-P5)
- Fast development cycles and testability (CONST-P9, CONST-P12)

**Decision Drivers**:
- Performance requirements for concurrent users
- Developer productivity and learning curve
- Community support and ecosystem maturity
- Type safety and code maintainability
- Integration capabilities with Python AI/ML libraries
- Database ORM flexibility and migration support

## Decision
We have decided to use **FastAPI with SQLAlchemy (async)** as our backend technology stack.

**Core Stack**:
- **FastAPI**: Modern, fast web framework for building APIs
- **SQLAlchemy 2.0+ (async)**: Database ORM with async support
- **Alembic**: Database migration tool
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and serialization
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for production

## Considered Alternatives

### Alternative 1: Django REST Framework (DRF)
**Pros**:
- Mature ecosystem with extensive packages
- Built-in admin interface
- Comprehensive authentication system
- Large community and documentation

**Cons**:
- Primarily synchronous (async support limited)
- Heavier framework with more opinions
- Less optimal for API-only applications
- Slower request/response cycle

**Verdict**: Rejected due to limited async support and heavier footprint for API-focused application.

### Alternative 2: Flask with Flask-RESTful
**Pros**:
- Lightweight and flexible
- Large ecosystem of extensions
- Familiar to many Python developers
- Easy to customize

**Cons**:
- Requires more manual configuration
- No built-in async support
- Less modern approach to API development
- Requires additional libraries for OpenAPI/Swagger

**Verdict**: Rejected due to lack of built-in async support and more manual setup requirements.

### Alternative 3: Express.js (Node.js)
**Pros**:
- Native async/await support
- Fast development for APIs
- Large package ecosystem (npm)
- Good performance for I/O operations

**Cons**:
- Different language from AI/ML ecosystem
- Less type safety without TypeScript
- Context switching between Python and Node.js
- Team expertise primarily in Python

**Verdict**: Rejected to maintain language consistency and leverage existing Python expertise.

## Decision Rationale

### Why FastAPI
1. **Constitutional Alignment**:
   - **CONST-P1 (API First)**: FastAPI is designed specifically for building APIs with automatic OpenAPI generation
   - **CONST-P2 (Async & Non-Blocking)**: Native async/await support throughout the framework
   - **CONST-P3 (Extensibility)**: Dependency injection system enables clean abstractions
   - **CONST-P5 (Security by Default)**: Built-in security features and OAuth2 integration
   - **CONST-P9 (Testable Units)**: Excellent testing support with dependency override capabilities

2. **Technical Benefits**:
   - Automatic API documentation generation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
   - Built-in request/response validation with Pydantic
   - High performance comparable to Node.js and Go
   - Type hints throughout for better IDE support and maintainability
   - Modern Python features (3.8+) with async/await

3. **Developer Experience**:
   - Intuitive decorator-based routing
   - Automatic request parsing and validation
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Built-in testing client
   - Excellent documentation and community support

### Why SQLAlchemy (Async)
1. **Database Flexibility**:
   - Support for multiple database backends
   - Advanced ORM features with raw SQL escape hatches
   - Comprehensive migration support via Alembic
   - Relationship mapping and lazy loading

2. **Async Support**:
   - Full async/await support in SQLAlchemy 2.0+
   - Non-blocking database operations
   - Connection pooling for concurrent requests
   - Compatible with FastAPI's async nature

3. **Development Benefits**:
   - Type hints and IDE autocompletion
   - Flexible query building
   - Database schema evolution through migrations
   - Testing support with in-memory databases

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- [x] FastAPI application structure with routers
- [x] SQLAlchemy models and database configuration
- [x] Alembic migration system setup
- [x] Basic authentication with JWT
- [x] Development environment configuration

### Phase 2: Core Features
- [ ] Implement PLAN-002 (API-First Development) endpoints
- [ ] Database schema for content management (PLAN-007)
- [ ] Role-based access control (PLAN-004)
- [ ] Structured logging integration (PLAN-008)

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Module system integration (PLAN-003)
- [ ] AI provider abstraction layer (PLAN-005)
- [ ] Health monitoring endpoints (PLAN-009)
- [ ] Performance optimization and caching

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Performance**: High-performance async operations supporting concurrent users
- **Developer Productivity**: Fast development cycles with automatic documentation
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type hints improve code quality and maintainability
- **Testing**: Excellent testing capabilities with dependency injection
- **Future-Proof**: Modern framework with active development and community

### Negative Consequences
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn FastAPI patterns and async programming
- **Async Complexity**: Potential complexity in handling async operations correctly
- **Migration Effort**: Future technology changes would require significant refactoring
- **Dependencies**: Reliance on SQLAlchemy async drivers and their maturity

### Risk Mitigation
- **Training**: Provide FastAPI and async programming training for the team
- **Documentation**: Create internal guides for common patterns and best practices
- **Code Review**: Establish review processes focusing on async best practices

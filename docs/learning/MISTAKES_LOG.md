## 📝 Active Learning Areas

### Current Focus: Preventing Common Beginner Mistakes

**Environment & Setup**:
- [ ] Verify Node.js and Python versions before starting
- [ ] Check package.json and requirements.txt for conflicts
- [ ] Test local development environment after changes
- [ ] Document environment setup steps

**Code Development**:
- [ ] Run TypeScript compiler before committing
- [ ] Test API endpoints after changes
- [ ] Validate forms and error handling
- [ ] Check responsive design on different screens

**Git & Process**:
- [ ] Write meaningful commit messages
- [ ] Create feature branches for all changes
- [ ] Update documentation with code changes
- [ ] Link commits to TASK-### references

## 🚨 Common Patterns to Watch For

### Red Flags (Stop and Think)
- **No tests written** → Risk of breaking changes
- **Hardcoded values** → Configuration should be external
- **No error handling** → App will crash on edge cases
- **Missing TypeScript types** → Runtime errors likely
- **Direct database access in components** → Violates architecture
- **Copying code without understanding** → Technical debt accumulation

### Green Flags (Good Practices)
- **Tests written first** → Clear requirements and validation
- **Configuration externalized** → Flexible and maintainable
- **Error boundaries implemented** → Graceful failure handling
- **Strong typing used** → Catch errors at compile time
- **Clean separation of concerns** → Easy to maintain and extend
- **Understanding before implementation** → Sustainable development

## 🛠️ Prevention Tools

### Automated Checks
- **ESLint**: Catches common JavaScript/TypeScript issues
- **Prettier**: Ensures consistent code formatting
- **TypeScript Compiler**: Catches type errors before runtime
- **Governance Validation**: Ensures process compliance

### Manual Checklists
**Before Committing**:
- [ ] Code runs without errors locally
- [ ] Tests pass (when applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Commit message follows semantic format
- [ ] References appropriate TASK-###

**Before Deploying**:
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Security scan shows no issues
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Rollback plan exists

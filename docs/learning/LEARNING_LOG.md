## üéì Weekly Learning Entries

### Week 1 (Sep 16-20, 2025)
**Focus**: Project Setup & Governance

**What I Learned**:
- Constitutional principles create decision-making framework
- Spec Kit workflow prevents building wrong features
- AI agents require clear boundaries and oversight
- Planning-first approach saves time later

**Challenges Faced**:
- Overwhelming amount of setup initially
- Learning curve for governance concepts
- Balancing process with progress

**Solutions Found**:
- Break governance into digestible pieces
- Use templates to reduce friction
- Validate incrementally

**Next Week Goals**:
- Complete learning automation setup

## üîÑ Process Reflections

### What's Working Well
- **Governance Structure**: Prevents analysis paralysis
- **Traceability**: Easy to understand why decisions were made
- **AI Guidelines**: Helps avoid blind acceptance of suggestions
- **Documentation**: Creates knowledge base for future reference

### What's Challenging
- **Initial Setup Time**: Lots of infrastructure before coding
- **Process Overhead**: Sometimes feels heavy for small changes
- **Learning Curve**: Many new concepts at once

### Adjustments Made
- Created templates to reduce documentation friction
- Set up validation scripts to catch errors early
- Established clear AI collaboration boundaries

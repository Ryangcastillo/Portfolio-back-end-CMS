**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-09-20  
**Deciders**: Project Team  
**Consulted**: Development Team  
**Informed**: All Contributors  

## Context and Problem Statement
We need to select a frontend technology stack for Stitch CMS that provides an optimal user experience while maintaining development efficiency and aligning with our Constitutional principles. The frontend must handle content management interfaces, user authentication, real-time updates, and integration with our FastAPI backend.

**Key Requirements**:
- Modern, responsive user interface for content management
- Server-side rendering for performance and SEO
- Component-based architecture for reusability
- Integration with backend APIs (FastAPI)
- Authentication and authorization flows
- Real-time updates for collaborative features
- Mobile-responsive design
- Accessibility compliance

**Decision Drivers**:
- Developer productivity and learning curve
- Performance and user experience
- SEO and initial page load times
- Community support and ecosystem
- Integration capabilities with React ecosystem
- Long-term maintainability
- Deployment and hosting flexibility

## Decision
We have decided to use **Next.js 14+ with App Router** as our frontend technology stack.

**Core Stack**:
- **Next.js 14+**: React framework with App Router
- **React 18+**: Component library with concurrent features
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript development
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Shadcn/ui**: Component library built on Radix UI
- **React Hook Form**: Form handling and validation
- **TanStack Query (React Query)**: Server state management
- **NextAuth.js**: Authentication for Next.js applications

## Considered Alternatives

### Alternative 1: Create React App (CRA) with React Router
**Pros**:
- Simple setup and configuration
- Full client-side rendering flexibility
- Direct control over build process
- Large community and resources

**Cons**:
- No server-side rendering out of the box
- Poor SEO performance
- Requires additional setup for routing, state management
- Build optimization requires manual configuration
- Facebook has deprecated CRA in favor of other solutions

**Verdict**: Rejected due to lack of SSR, poor SEO, and deprecated status.

### Alternative 2: Vue.js with Nuxt.js
**Pros**:
- Excellent developer experience
- Built-in SSR and static site generation
- Vue's gentle learning curve
- Good performance characteristics

**Cons**:
- Different ecosystem from React
- Team expertise primarily in React
- Smaller community compared to React
- Less integration with existing React libraries

**Verdict**: Rejected to leverage existing React expertise and ecosystem.

### Alternative 3: Vite + React + React Router
**Pros**:
- Fast development server and builds
- Modern build tooling
- Flexible configuration
- Good developer experience

**Cons**:
- No built-in SSR (requires additional setup)
- Manual configuration for many features
- SEO limitations without SSR
- Additional complexity for routing and state management

**Verdict**: Rejected due to lack of built-in SSR and additional configuration overhead.

### Alternative 4: Remix
**Pros**:
- Excellent data loading patterns
- Built-in SSR and progressive enhancement
- Focus on web standards
- Good performance characteristics

**Cons**:
- Newer framework with smaller ecosystem
- Different mental model from traditional SPAs
- Team unfamiliarity with framework
- Less third-party integrations available

**Verdict**: Rejected due to team unfamiliarity and preference for established patterns.

- [x] Next.js application with App Router structure
- [x] TypeScript configuration and strict mode
- [x] Tailwind CSS integration and custom configuration
- [x] Component library setup (Shadcn/ui)
- [x] Basic layout and navigation structure

### Phase 2: Authentication & Core UI
- [ ] NextAuth.js integration with FastAPI backend
- [ ] Protected routes and middleware
- [ ] Dashboard layout and navigation
- [ ] Form components with validation
- [ ] Data fetching patterns with TanStack Query

### Phase 3: Content Management Features
- [ ] Content editor with rich text support
- [ ] File upload and media management
